            "body":"<p>Growth this year is likely to miss the government’s 3 per cent forecast, undermining the boast by <a title=\"George Osborne - Topics - Financial Times\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/topics/people/George_Osborne\">George Osborne</a> that the British economy was growing faster than any of its key rivals.</p>\n<p>A series of official revisions to UK economic output estimates showed the annual rate of gross domestic product growth in the third quarter falling from 3 per cent to 2.6 per cent. </p>\n<p>The figures came as the US simultaneously posted its <a title=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5519edb4-8ab0-11e4-be0e-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5519edb4-8ab0-11e4-be0e-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk\">fastest rate of economic expansion</a> in more than a decade, with growth at an annualised rate of 5 per cent in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The UK setback came only weeks after the <a title=\"Autumn Statement 2014: The chancellor’s speech - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a3fb6aaa-7ae5-11e4-8646-00144feabdc0.html\">chancellor told MPs </a>the country was on track to be the “fastest growing of any major advanced economy in the world”.</p>\n<p>Phillip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said there was “not much seasonal cheer” in the new numbers and that there was now “no way” that the <a title=\"UK Economy - latest UK economy news headlines - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/global-economy/uk\">UK economy</a> was going to grow by 3 per cent overall for 2014 as the Office for Budgetary Responsibility had forecast earlier this month</p>\n<p>Sterling fell to a 16-month low against the dollar as traders bet that the Federal Reserve was increasingly likely to raise interest rates before the Bank of England. </p>\n<p>An ally of Mr Osborne said official revisions “come and go”, adding: “These are in no way a major blow; they are small revisions to past quarters that don’t significantly change the picture of the recovery.”</p>\n<p>But Labour said the figures were disappointing, given that growth had been revised downwards by the Office for National Statistics for five of the past six quarters — while exports and business investments were weak.</p>\n<p>The new data also showed the country’s current account deficit sank to a record £27bn in the third quarter, or 6 per cent of GDP.</p>\n<p>“The chancellor has totally failed to rebalance the economy as he promised,” said Shabana Mahmood, shadow Treasury minister. “These are concerning figures.”</p>\n<p>The ONS made the downward revisions on Tuesday due to weakness in the production industries and a greater drag from trade.</p>\n<p>While growth in the third quarter was confirmed at 0.7 per cent, the previous downward revisions mean this increase came from a lower base, resulting in the cut in the annual GDP growth rate in the third quarter. </p>\n<p>Mr Shaw pointed out that it was important to remember where the UK economy had been a couple of years ago, adding: “We’ve made considerable progress, even if today’s figures are a setback.”</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"pullQuote\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics consultancy, said the latest figures “leave the UK’s economic recovery looking more fragile than it seemed before”.</p>\n<p>A Treasury spokesman said that weakness in the euro area and instability in global markets meant that now was a “critical moment” for the economy, and “we need to carry on working through our economic plan”.</p>\n<p>The breakdown of the statistics also showed that the recovery was a little less balanced than previously thought, with growth in household spending revised up and overall investment down. </p>\n<p>Households’ real disposable income also fell in the third quarter, meaning that consumers funded extra spending by <a title=\"Consumer splurge has shaky foundations - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3e29118-8aad-11e4-8e24-00144feabdc0.html\">reducing the proportion of income they saved </a>from 7.5 per cent to 7 per cent. </p>\n<p>That is another blow to Mr Osborne, given his repeated claims to be shifting the economy away from debt-fuelled growth.</p>\n<p>The deteriorating current account deficit was mainly due to falling receipts from foreign direct investment, and rising payments including dividends to foreign investors.</p>\n<p>Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said that while the deficit did not seem to be a problem right now, it showed how much the UK relied on overseas investors buying its debt. </p>\n<p>“If the UK falls out of favour with international investors for any reason, the economy might be forced to rebalance the hard way — i e with a combination of currency depreciation to make exports more competitive and lower domestic demand to suck in fewer imports,” he said. </p>\n<p>Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said taken together the data “took some of the gloss off the recent good news we’ve been getting”.</p>"
